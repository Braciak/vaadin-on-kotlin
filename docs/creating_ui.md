# Creating UIs

Vaadin-on-Kotlin uses the [Vaadin Framework](https://vaadin.com/docs/v8/framework/introduction/intro-overview.html) to deliver the UI.
Vaadin is a single-page Rich Internet Application framework with the programming paradigm that resembles desktop toolkits like JavaFX
and Swing. You add components such as Button and TextField into the page, nesting them in layouts which define the component placement on page.
